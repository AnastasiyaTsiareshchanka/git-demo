She gets on with life as a tester,
She's a little kinda gal.
She likes doing nothing and watching youtube.
She likes to contemplate her.
But when she starts to daydream,
Her mind turns straight to pizza.

Sometimes I look at her and I look into her eyes,
I notice the way she thinks about pizza with a smile,
Curved lips she just can't keep unnoticed.
But she thinks it's her making her life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for her to decide which she loves more?
Her or...
Pizza?
